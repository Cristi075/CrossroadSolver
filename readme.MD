# Crossroad Scenario Solver  
This is a project that I implemented for the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence that i take at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca.  
The purpose of this project is to take a situation that describes a given number of drivers at a cross-shaped or T-shaped crossroad and determine in which order they will cross according to the rules of the road from Romania.  
For this project I used (https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python) and made some small non-functional adjustments to it.  
From aima-python I used the environment class to model the crossroad and I used a simple reflex agent to model the drivers and their behaviour.
